# GraphQL Codegen

This project contains a codegeneration tool for GraphQL in Dart. It allows you
to generate type-safe Dart classes for your GraphQL operations.

It contains the following packages

* [graphql_codegen](/graphql_codegen) - The build runner generating the Dart classes.
* [graphql_codegen_config](/graphql_codegen_config) - A package holding the configs for `graphql_codegen`.

You'll probably only need `graphql_codegen`.
